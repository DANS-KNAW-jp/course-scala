# Shape
1. Define a trait `Shape` and case classes `Rectangle` (with parameters `width` and `height`) and `Circle` (with parameter `radius`) that inherit from `Shape`.
2. Implement an object with two functions that calculate the circumference and area of a `Shape`.
3. What would be the best way of implementing this in a strictly object oriented language like Java?
    1. Describe this
    2. Implement this in Scala
    3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods?
4. Would it be useful to declare `Shape` as a `sealed trait` in either of these cases?
    1. Can you add extra subclasses in either of these cases?
    2. Can you add extra functions in either of these cases?
